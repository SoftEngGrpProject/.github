# AR.it

Welcome to **AR.it**! Our social media app offers a unique way to document and share memories with others.<br>
With augmented reality technology, users can integrate and overlay real-world content with their memories, creating a safe alternative to the metaverse.

Our app's key features include the Scrapbook, where users can organise and store memories in a scrapbook-style format. Users can also view their media content on a Scrap Map, which shows all the locations where they have shared their images on a map. Additionally, our app supports AR functionality, allowing users to view their photos and videos in their real-world surroundings.

To get started, head over to our **Documentation**, where you'll find all the information you need to begin using our app.
